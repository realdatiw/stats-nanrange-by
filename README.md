2. **Launch the Application:** Double-click the executable file to open the program. You will see a simple interface.

3. **Input Your Data:** Provide the numeric data in the designated input area. You can easily type in your values or copy-paste them.

4. **Select Dimensions:** Specify the dimensions along which you want to compute the range. This may be a single dimension or multiple dimensions.

5. **Compute the Range:** Click the button to calculate the range. The results will appear immediately, showing the range while ignoring any NaN values.

## 📊 Example Usage

To give you an idea of how this tool works, imagine you have a set of data as follows:

```
[3, NaN, 7]
```

When you input this data, the program will calculate the range as follows:

- It ignores the NaN value.
- The range is calculated as `max(3, 7) - min(3, 7)` = `7 - 3` = `4`.
